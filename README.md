# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Challenge 17
Deliverable 4: Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis (30 points)
Deliverable 4 Instructions
For this deliverable, you’ll write a brief summary and analysis of the performance of all the machine learning models used in this Challenge.

The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.

Deliverable 4 Requirements
Structure, Organization, and Formatting (6 points)
The written analysis has the following structure, organization, and formatting:

There is a title, and there are multiple sections (2 pt)
Each section has a heading and subheading (2 pt)
Links to images are working, and code is formatted and displayed correctly (2 pt).
Analysis (24 points)
The written analysis has the following:

Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is well defined (4 pt)
Results:

There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)
Summary:

There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)
Submission
Once you’re ready to submit, make sure to check your work against the rubric to ensure you are meeting the requirements for this Challenge one final time. It’s easy to overlook items when you’re in the zone!
